# Contribution guidelines

Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!

If you want an item to be added to the list, it must:

1. Be awesome.
2. Be relevant to ComputerCraft. It could be an awesome ComputerCraft extension mod, or an awesome tutorial. It cannot be your friend's cat's Facebook page, or your irrelevant project.
3. Can be immediately used. It has to have an installation script, or (in the case of literature) immediately read.

## Document styling

Added items should be in alphabetical order, with some exceptions:
- The ComputerCraft Mods subsection is sorted manually, to keep the modern mods on top and the legacy mods at the bottom.
- The Resources section is sorted manually, from preferred resources to avoided resources.

### List entries

For non-literature items, follow this format:

```md
- My Awesome Thing: An awesome thing for ComputerCraft. **[Source](https://github.com/tomodachi94/awesome-computercraft) - [Docs](https://example.com)**
```

### Table of contents

A Table of Contents should be updated by the [*Marky Dynamic* extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=robole.marky-dynamic) for VSCode. Manually remove the "Contents" and "Footnotes" sections.

## Reorganization of the list

PRs doing a major refactor of the list will generally not be accepted.

## Commit messages

Commit messages should be written in the present tense, with natural capitalization and no periods:

```
Add <item> and <item>
Add <section>
Fix [typo|dead link|<error type>]
```

However, do what makes the most sense.
